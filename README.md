# SonicPiSong
This song was based off of lo fi beats and jazz samples that I found on youtube. I have no music experience other than playing the trumpet in fifth grade and knew nothing about chord progessions or making music. This whole project was a challenge as everything was new to me. 

There was no live coding but i used a beat counter to change when certain elements would be played or when to change the bpm. To make the song sound interesting I added different elements at different times and tried to mix it up as time went on. I had bigger goals but sonic pi was hard to work with without live coding because there really isnt a way to stop a loop and let another loop just play out alone in the middle of a song which made it much harder to manipulate.

I originally tried to do a guitar cover of a song I liked but I both can't read music or play a guitar on sonic pi and then I tried to use piano sheet music but I cant read music or rythm. I then tried to to make the beats from scratch and have no experiecne with musical timing so I resorted to using samples I had previously heard in my life and added elements based of that.

 The assignment asked me to include what I wrote down as I brainstormed, but all of my brainstorms didn't work out as they were just notes of sheet music I was trying to convert to sonic pi, which I could not figure out. 

 The music video is me playing subway surfers really poorly because a social media tactic that has come out in the last year has been to play a video overlaid above gameplay of subway surfers. This has led to vast increases in watch retention (as attention spans shorten) and consequently virality.
 
 To run the code you can either listen to the wav file which is the first 5 minutes of the song (it doenst change after that) or you can move the samples to your machine and then change the paths of the sample calls to the ones from where you saved them and run it from sonic Pi. Future work would be adding a guitar and cleaning up the sound in plaves where it sounds very congested
